The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

## Loading the data and summary statistics 
At first, the data set is loaded and summary statistics are provided.

```{r}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv")) # loading data set
skim(hr_dataset) # summary statistics

```

Data set reveals there are 26 Quantitative and 9 qualitative parameters about employees working at IBM. However, this is not a true picture as there are many rating-based and level-based variables Viz. Education level, Environment satisfaction etc. which have been coded as numeric values and hence a basic data cleaning is necessary. One important observation is that the data has no missing values.

## Data cleaning and reorganising

```{r}

# Basic Data Cleaning and re-coding of levels

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion,)


skim(hr_cleaned) # summary statistics

```

Post data cleaning, we are left with 19 attributes in total. Of which - 9 are Numeric and rest are qualitative.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Creating new subsets of hr_cleaned for later analyses on factors like Job Satisfaction, Education level, Environment satisfaction, Performance ratings and Work satisfaction among employees across departments.
 
```{r}
JobSat<-hr_cleaned%>% # creating variable
  group_by(department)%>% # grouping by department
  count(job_satisfaction)%>% # counting variable enclosed by grouped variable 
  mutate(n_percent=n/sum(n)) # adding a proportion 

Edu<-hr_cleaned%>% # creating variable
  group_by(department)%>% # grouping by department
  count(education)%>% # counting variable enclosed by grouped variable 
  mutate(n_percent=n/sum(n)) # adding a proportion

Enviro<-hr_cleaned%>% # creating variable
  group_by(department)%>% # grouping by department
  count(environment_satisfaction)%>% # counting variable enclosed by grouped variable
  mutate(n_percent=n/sum(n)) # adding a proportion

Perf<-hr_cleaned%>% # creating variable
  group_by(department)%>% # grouping by department
  count(performance_rating)%>% # counting variable enclosed by grouped variable
  mutate(n_percent=n/sum(n)) # adding a proportion

Work<-hr_cleaned%>% # creating variable
  group_by(department)%>% # grouping by department
  count(work_life_balance)%>% # counting variable enclosed by grouped variable
  mutate(n_percent=n/sum(n)) # adding a proportion

```


```{r}

ggplot(Edu)+
  aes(x=education, y = n_percent, fill = education)+ # speciyfying axes
  geom_col()+  # generating graph
  facet_grid(~department)+ # faceting by department
  labs(title="Education Level by Department at IBM", # adding labels and colouring 
       x="Department",
       y="Percentage Education",
       fill= "Education Level")+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5)) # adjusting x axis label

```

Though there's an almost comparable mix of education levels of employees across department, most of the employees are Bachelor-level educated in all departments. More employees hold Masters in Sales than other departments. This data maybe slightly surprising at first, as R&D is expected to have the highest proportion of highly skilled employees. However, it may be the case that a large number of employees in R&D are involved in roles such as project management where the a high skill level is not required.  



```{r}

Enviro %>% ggplot()+ # creating variable 
  aes(x=environment_satisfaction, # specifying axes and colouring
      y = n_percent, 
      fill=environment_satisfaction)+
  geom_col()+ # generating graph
  facet_grid(~department)+ # faceting by department
labs(title="Environment Satisfaction by Department at IBM", # adding title and labels
       x="Department",
       y="Percentage Vote",
       fill= "Environment Satisfaction")+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5)) # adjusting x axis
```

Around 41% employees in HR seems to be satisfied with the environmental conditions, this seems to be because one of the key roles of the HR department is to keep a positive organisational environment. 31% of Research employees felt very highly satisfied by Environmental conditions, a reason for this could be - R&D is a highly specialised department, therefore the people who join such roles are specifically trained for this and expect what is to come. However, sales guys seems to be divided into comparable groups of employees to have voted for all the categories in the range 20%-30%.

Post this, it would be interesting to look at how departments perform. 


```{r}
ggplot(Perf,aes(x=department, y=n_percent, # specifying axes and colouring
                fill=factor(performance_rating, 
                            levels=c("Outstanding", "Excellent", "Good" , "Low"))))+
 geom_col()+ # generating graph
 labs(title="Performance Rating by Department at IBM",  # adding title and labels
       x="Department",
       y="Percentage Vote",
       fill= "Performance Rating")+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5)) # adjusting x axis

```

Performance ratings seems to be equally distributed across employees across departments. This is an interesting statistic given the mixed environmental satisfaction response. Despite such a positive performance rating, on average one in five employees are dissatisfied with the environmental conditions. Further, an attrition rate analysis seems to be logical.   


## Attrition Rates

```{r}
overalll_attrition <- hr_cleaned %>% # creating variable
  group_by(attrition) %>% # grouping by attrition
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # counting variable
  mutate(overall_attrition = paste(round(count*100/sum(count),0),"%",sep="")) %>% # adding a variable
  filter(attrition=="Yes") %>% # filtering 
  select(overall_attrition) # selecting overall attrition

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(attrition, department) %>% # grouping by variables
  summarise(count=n()) %>% # counting by grouped variables
  group_by(department) %>% # grouping by department
  mutate(attrition_rate=paste(round(count*100/sum(count),0),"%",sep="")) %>% # adding a variable and rounding
  filter(attrition=="Yes") %>% # filtering
  select(department, attrition_rate) %>% # selecting certain variables
  ungroup() %>% # ungrouping previously grouped variables
  add_row(department = 'Overall' , attrition_rate = overalll_attrition[[1]]) # adding an additional row with a variable


hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(attrition, department) %>% # grouping by variables
  summarise(count=n()) %>% # counting by grouped variables
  group_by(department) %>% # grouping by department
  mutate(attrition_rate=paste(round(count*100/sum(count),0),"%",sep="")) %>% # adding a variable and rounding
  filter(attrition=="Yes") %>% # filtering
  select(department, attrition_rate) %>% ungroup() %>% # selecting certain variables
  add_row(department = 'Overall' , attrition_rate = overalll_attrition[[1]]) %>% # adding an additional row with a variable 
  mutate(per_value = as.numeric(substr(attrition_rate,1,2))) %>% # creating a variable
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = department , y =per_value)+ # specifying axes
  geom_col(fill="#8b9dc3")+ # generating graph
  theme_bw()+ # adding a black and white theme
  labs(title = "Attrition Rates at IBM", x="Department", y="Attrition Rate (%)") # adding labels and title 

```

The overall attrition seems to be around 16%. This is in line with our previous analysis which indicated that around 20% employees felt dissatisfied with the environmental conditions. Over 20% of Sales employees attrite. and R&D has minimum attrition. This data is logical as research and development is a proprietary role and IBM must have put in place non-compete policies for such employees. On the other hand sales is a highly competitive fast paced role and thus high attrition is to be expected.     

Subsequently, distributions of age, years at IBM, monthly income and years since last promotion have been analysed.

## Distributions

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=age))+  #specifying x axis
  geom_density(fill="#8b9dc3")+ #generating density plot
  facet_wrap(~department) #facet by department

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(department) %>%  #grouped by department
  summarize(mean_age=round(mean(age),0), #calculating mean_age and rounded it to 0 decimal place
            median_age = round(median(age),0)) #calculating median age
```

The age of employees working in different departments seems to be fairly normally distributed with a mean age of around 37 Yrs. Median age is about 36 Yrs (very close to the average suggesting minimal extreme values). The bump to the right extreme of these curves represent perhaps the senior management  age group as they are expected to have more experience and age.

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=years_at_company))+  #specifying x axes
  geom_density(fill="#8b9dc3") +   #generating density plot
  labs (x="Years at Company") + #adding x label
  facet_wrap(~department) #facet by department
```

As for years at company, across departments the distribution seems to be very right skewed suggesting most employees leave in around 15 years. 

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=monthly_income)) +  #specifying x  axes
  geom_density(fill="#8b9dc3") +  #generating density plot
  labs(x="Monthly Income")+ #adding x label
  facet_wrap(~department) #facet by department
```

As per intuition, monthly income is right skewed with avg. monthly income of R&D folks being on higher side - given the nature of their job role and the experience required. Most of the Sales people draw around USD 55,00 - 6,00 monthly. HR seems to be earning the least on a relative scale. 

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=years_since_last_promotion))+ #specifying x axes
  geom_density(fill="#8b9dc3") + #generating density plot
  labs(x="Years Since Last Promotion")+  #adding x label
  facet_wrap(~department) #facet by department
```


Distribution of Years since last promoted indicates that HR and Sales employees spend more time between promotions than R&D folks.
